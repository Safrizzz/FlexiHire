The system provides an integrated platform for job discovery, job posting management, application tracking, messaging, and **instant payment upon job completion**, which distinguishes FlexiHire from conventional job platforms.

This project is developed as an academic software engineering project and demonstrates the application of mobile development, system analysis, and role-based navigation concepts.
